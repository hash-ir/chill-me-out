This project was implemented and submitted in hackaTUM 2019 at Technical University of Munich under the JetBrains track. We developed an IntelliJ plugin which invokes a Python script. The script consists of a trained Deep Learning Model (`model.py`) which predicts the stress level (0-100) of the user. This is done in real-time through VideoCapture from OpenCV. The stress value is written to a text file (`stress.txt`) which is read simulataneously by the plugin app. Depending on the stress level, a Joke API is invoked which sends back random programming jokes from the Internet. Currently, the stress level is thresholded at 65. The final feedback is presented as a message in a tooltip in the lower right corner.
